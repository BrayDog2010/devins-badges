# Contributing

If you want to contribute a badge, simply PR the SVG to a folder. I'm typically pretty picky with design choices, but I tried to make the guidelines not too restrictive. You **must** follow these guidelines when designing a badge that you want added to the repository:

1. Use only one or two colors. Also, be sure to use a bright color. If the logo has many colors, that's okay.
2. Attempt to use simple logos if possible to reduce complexity.
3. Follow brand guidelines to the best of your ability.
4. If the logo is not an SVG, then be sure to downscale it to around 48-64 pixels before importing so that it doesn't take much bandwidth.
5. If the logo *is* an SVG, then make sure that it loads properly in most modern browsers.
6. Do not change the text's color, font, or size. It could affect readability.
7. Do not change badge height/padding.

If I need anything changed, I'll make a comment on your PR. I may be busy at times though.
