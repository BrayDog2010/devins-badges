# Devin's Badges v4

At the moment this is the development branch for Devin's Badges v4. Goals with v4:

- New, simpler badge design that has better readability and visuals
- Much simplified and more logical project structure for easier maintenance
  - I plan on just using SVGs and not including a central project file, this way badges can be PRed properly. You will still need to use Figma to create badges

I do not recommend using this branch for your project at the moment as a lot of things may change often, including various breaking changes. I'll update this README with more information as v4 is developed.
